# Predispositions to eating disorders in adolescent athletes.

Eating disorders are a serious concern among adolescent athletes. This study looked at how sports might be a risk factor for developing an eating disorder. We surveyed 130 athletes between the ages of 12-22, and found that there is a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of eating disorders between athletes who are involved in aesthetic-coordination sports and those who are involved in other sports. The study also found that the risk of developing an eating disorder increases with the amount of active involvement in sports an athlete has. It is important for public health officials to work to prevent eating disorders in adolescent athletes.

## Data collection

Information from young athletes aged between 12 to 22 years old was gathered by utilizing a questionnaire that was designed based on the EAT-26 standardized questionnaire.

Graphical representation of the distribution of respondents by gender and age, n=130.The survey was conducted on different age groups. The first group consisted of 68 male and female respondents aged 12 to 17. The second group consisted of 62 male and female respondents aged 17 to 22. This allowed for a comparison of results between the different age groups.

## Hypotheses:
- We hypothesize that a specific type of sport may represent a risk factor for the occurrence of eating disorders.
- We hypothesize that girls have a higher risk of predisposition to eating disorders compared to boys.
- We hypothesize that younger athletes are more exposed to this risk factor than older athletes.
- We hypothesize that longer engagement in sports influences the risk of developing eating disorders.
- We hypothesize that there is no difference in BMI values between men and women.
- We hypothesize that there is no difference in BMI values among respondents based on the type of sport they engage in.
