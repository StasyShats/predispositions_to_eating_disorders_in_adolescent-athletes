# Predispositions to eating disorders in adolescent athletes.

Eating disorders are a serious concern among adolescent athletes. This study looked at how sports might be a risk factor for developing an eating disorder. We surveyed 130 athletes between the ages of 12-22, and found that there is a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of eating disorders between athletes who are involved in aesthetic-coordination sports and those who are involved in other sports. The study also found that the risk of developing an eating disorder increases with the amount of active involvement in sports an athlete has. It is important for public health officials to work to prevent eating disorders in adolescent athletes.

## Data collection

Information from young athletes aged between 12 to 22 years old was gathered by utilizing a questionnaire that was designed based on the EAT-26 standardized questionnaire.
